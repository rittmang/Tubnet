# Tubnet

Do not ask me how to install yet, I don't know.

On my PC, I can run it as :

```sh
$ npm start
```

in the project directory (where src, package etc is present)

In case CTRL+Shift+I shows version error that is was compiled using Node 64 or something, run:

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
```
